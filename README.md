# MVC-CMS Blog App


## Description

A social-media-style CMS Blog application that allows users to register and login by creating a unique, cookie-based session with Express.
The user can create, edit, and delete posts from the database, as well as comment and like posts from other users. 
The back-end controllers manage the routes and SQL queries through Sequelize and MySQL2.
The front-end is generated via the template engine Handlebars.js. This app uses the Bulma CLI for the CSS styling. It also utilizes a RESTful API to communicate with the back-end.
